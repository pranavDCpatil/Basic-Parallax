      <h2>Computer</h2>
      <p>
        A computer is a machine that can be instructed to carry out sequences of
        arithmetic or logical operations automatically via computer programming.
        Modern computers have the ability to follow generalized sets of
        operations, called programs. These programs enable computers to perform
        an extremely wide range of tasks. A "complete" computer including the
        hardware, the operating system (main software), and peripheral equipment
        required and used for "full" operation can be referred to as a computer
        system. This term may as well be used for a group of computers that are
        connected and work together, in particular a computer network or
        computer cluster.

      <h2>Programming</h2>
      <p>
        A programming language is a formal language comprising a set of
        instructions that produce various kinds of output. Programming languages
        are used in computer programming to implement algorithms. Most
        programming languages consist of instructions for computers. There are
        programmable machines that use a set of specific instructions, rather
        than general programming languages

      <h2>Software</h2>
      <p>
        Computer software, or simply software, is a collection of data or
        computer instructions that tell the computer how to work. This is in
        contrast to physical hardware, from which the system is built and
        actually performs the work. In computer science and software
        engineering, computer software is all information processed by computer
        systems, programs and data. Computer software includes computer
        programs, libraries and related non-executable data, such as online
        documentation or digital media. Computer hardware and software require
        each other and neither can be realistically used on its own.
